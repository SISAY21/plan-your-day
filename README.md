# Task Management App

This is a React-based task management application that uses Supabase for backend services. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app features:

- **Global State Management**: Uses `useReducer` with React Context for centralized state management.
- **Task Editing**: Users can easily switch to edit mode, with controlled input fields for seamless task updates.
- **Filtering**: Tasks can be filtered based on completion status or search queries.
- **Real-Time Updates**: All task operations update both the frontend and the Supabase backend in real time.

This app provides a smooth and intuitive interface for managing tasks efficiently.
